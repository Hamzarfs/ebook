const faqData = [
  {
    question: "What should go on the front of a book?",
    answer: "The front cover of a book should feature the author's name, the book title, and engaging imagery. These elements work together to create an inviting and informative first impression that draws readers in. Think of the cover as your bookâ€™s chance to shine and make an impact before anyone even flips it open."
  },
  {
    question: "Who owns the creative work?",
    answer: "As the author, you retain full ownership of all aspects of your print book. This means you have the creative control to decide how your work is presented and shared with the world. Our role is simply to assist you in formatting the book to make it look as polished and professional as possible."
  },
  {
    question: "What does book formatting mean?",
    answer: "Book formatting involves the visual presentation of your manuscript, including aspects like font size, page color, word count, page numbers, line spacing, and paragraph breaks. It ensures that your text is not only readable but also aesthetically pleasing, creating a comfortable reading experience for your audience. Good formatting can make a significant difference in how your story is perceived."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I want to make changes to the formatted draft you sent?",
    answer: "No worries at all! We offer unlimited formatting changes until you are completely satisfied with the draft we provide. Just keep in mind that this unlimited option applies only to the first draft; once you approve the manuscript, any further adjustments will incur additional fees."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I see more examples of your formatted books?",
    answer: "Absolutely! We would be delighted to share more examples of our formatted books with you. Just reach out to us, and we will provide you with a selection of our work, showcasing the quality and style of formatting you can expect when you choose our services."
