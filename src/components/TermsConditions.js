                    <p>By completing an order with AMZ Book Publishing (i.e., making payment), you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to the terms and conditions outlined here. These terms form a legally binding agreement between the client and AMZ Book Publishing. By engaging our services, you consent to be bound by these terms, as specified below:</p>

                    <p><strong>Original Content Guarantee</strong></p>
                    <p>AMZ Book Publishing guarantees that all content delivered is original and free of plagiarism. To verify this, we provide a Copyscape report for each project. Please note that Copyscape does not scan text embedded in images, videos, or other non-readable media. If you require more comprehensive plagiarism checks beyond Copyscape, you may do so independently, as these are not included in our standard pricing. Rest assured that the content we deliver is original and exclusive.</p>

                    <p><strong>Full Ownership of Content</strong></p>
                    <p>Upon payment and delivery, all content created by AMZ Book Publishing becomes your exclusive property. We do not require acknowledgment or attribution for the work. Once delivered, you have full ownership and may publish or use the content as you see fit, entirely under your name or brand.</p>

                    <p><strong>Data Security</strong></p>
                    <p>We prioritize the protection of your personal information. Once an order is placed or personal data is submitted, we implement security measures, including SSL encryption, to safeguard your information. We do not retain sensitive data (e.g., credit card details, Social Security numbers, financial information) after the transaction is completed.</p>

                    <p><strong>Cookie Policy</strong></p>
                    <p>We use cookies to track advertisements and gather data on site traffic and interactions. This enables us to enhance user experience and improve our services. In some cases, we may partner with third-party service providers to assist with visitor analysis. These providers are strictly prohibited from using your information for any purpose other than customer behavior analysis.</p>

                    <p><strong>Image Usage Policy</strong></p>
                    <p>AMZ Book Publishing maintains compliance with copyright laws. We do not use copyrighted images without permission. Instead, we provide links to suggested images for your convenience. You may also use royalty-free images without concern. If copyrighted images are required, any associated costs will be borne by the client.</p>

                    <p><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
                    <p>Clients are advised to carefully review this clause. AMZ Book Publishing is not liable for any direct or indirect losses that may result from the use of our website or services/products purchased through it. This includes any potential damages related to viruses or material losses caused by accessing our website or using our products. We shall not be held responsible for any losses arising from the use or inability to use our services.</p>

                    <p><strong>Policy Updates</strong></p>
                    <p>Our terms and conditions may be updated periodically without prior notice. We recommend visiting this page regularly to stay informed of any changes.</p>

                    <p><strong>Refund Policy</strong></p>
                    <p>Please carefully review the following terms regarding AMZ Book Publishingâ€™s refund policy. If you have questions or need clarification, we encourage you to contact our customer service team for assistance. Refunds are issued only under special circumstances, as detailed below:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Purchases above $15,000:</strong> If approved, refunds for purchases exceeding $15,000 will be processed in equal monthly installments of $5,000.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Full Refund Conditions</strong></p>
                    <p>You may be eligible for a full refund if work on your project has commenced, but you decide to halt it. Our support team will assess your situation and provide the current status of your project, along with available options.</p>

                    <p><strong>Change of Mind</strong></p>
                    <p>If you change your mind after placing an order, you may request a refund within one hour of order placement. A 60% processing fee will apply to refunds requested after this period.</p>

                    <p><strong>Incomplete Delivery</strong></p>
                    <p>If the delivered work does not meet the project requirements (as documented by the client), you are entitled to revisions until satisfaction is achieved. We provide unlimited revisions and reassign work as needed. If the delivery remains unsatisfactory after multiple revisions, we may issue a refund based on mutual agreement, in proportion to the deviation from the agreed-upon scope.</p>

                    <p><strong>Refund Timeframe</strong></p>
                    <p>Refund requests must be submitted within 120 days of delivery. Requests made after this period will not be considered. Clients should take note of this deadline when placing an order.</p>

                    <p><strong>Cases Where Refunds Are Not Issued</strong></p>
                    <p>Refunds will not be issued for minor technical errors (e.g., grammar, typos, word count discrepancies) or delays caused by the client. Partial refunds or future discounts may be negotiated in such cases. Additionally, refunds are not granted for low-quality writing complaints. For book marketing or publishing projects, no refund will be provided if the client fails to grant access to necessary platforms (e.g., Amazon, Barnes & Noble, or social media accounts) required for effective marketing and sales optimization.</p>
