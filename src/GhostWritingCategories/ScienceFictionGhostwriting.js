const faqData = [
  {
    question: "What is science fiction writing?",
    answer: "Science fiction, or sci-fi for short, is all about exploring futuristic worlds and the consequences of technological advancements. What is great about sci-fi is that it plays by the rules of science. If a story starts leaning into magic or supernatural forces, then we are stepping into the realm of fantasy!"
  },
  {
    question: "What is fiction?",
    answer: "Fiction is like a big umbrella covering all sorts of creative writing that is not based on real-life events. It includes a ton of genres, each with its own flavor and themes. Even though these genres can be really different from one another, they often share some common threads that help us categorize them."
  },
  {
    question: "What are three common mistakes to avoid when writing science fiction?",
    answer: "When it comes to writing sci-fi, watch out for these three common traps: skipping on world-building, creating flat characters, and losing sight of the science! Building a believable universe, crafting rich characters, and keeping your scientific concepts grounded are all keys to a captivating story."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the different types of science fiction ghostwriting?",
    answer: "There is a whole world of science fiction ghostwriting to explore! You have hard sci-fi, which sticks closely to realistic technology and science. Then there is soft sci-fi, which dives deep into character development and emotional stories. And do not forget speculative fiction, which stretches the limits of what we know about science and society!"
